# Note Application

This is a minimal example demonstrating usage of the
password-protected user part of the API used in lab 5.

You can find more information about the API endpoints in
[the documentation](https://www.postman.com/cloudy-astronaut-813156/csc207-grade-apis-demo/documentation/fg3zkjm/5-password-protected-user).

If your team is considering an application for which it would be convenient to
store data in something like a database, you may find that the API calls demonstrated
here will be useful in your project, as this will allow you to store
an arbitrary JSON object associated with a username and password.

In this application, a single note has a name (the "username" in terms of the API) and the note
can be read by anyone who knows the name — but only edited by someone who
knows the password for it.


You can see the documentation in the various files for more information.

## User Stories
Person wants to search for a specific location. They type that location in the search bar and the map moves to that location and displays the weather. If they search for a place that doesnt exist, the software displays an error message.

Person wants to view weather alerts in a certain area. They see that displayed somewhere.

Person wants a quick overview of the weather in nearby areas. They can view a list of major nearby locations and select one.

Person wants to compare the weather in 2 different locations. They can pin the weather of a certain place to the ui to make it easier to compare it to the weather in other places.

Person wants to see what the weather was yesterday. They can select any hour from the past 24 hours to see what the weather was then.


## Testing

The repo also includes an example of a use case interactor test, as well as
an example of an end-to-end test which automates button clicks and inspects
the contents of the actual views. This is something we discussed in the lectures
about testing in CA but had not provided a code example of before. Note, one
could also inspect the contents of the ViewModel objects instead when testing
CA to make a similar test which would be less dependent on the details of the
specific UI implementation.

## Project Starter Code

Your team may choose to use this repo as starter code for your project. You could
also use the lab 5 code — or start from an empty repo if your team prefers.

If you choose to use one of the repositories we have provided, you can either make
a fork of it or copy the subset of code you want into a completely new repository.
