# WeatherWizard
The purpose of our Code is to create a Weather Application that is User friendly and can display several features. 

## User Stories
Person wants to search for a specific location. They type that location in the search bar and the map moves to that location and displays the weather. If they search for a place that doesnt exist, the software displays an error message.

Person does not understand metric units so they convert to imperial.

Person wants to view weather alerts in a certain area. They see that displayed somewhere.

Person wants a quick overview of the weather in nearby areas. They can view a list of major nearby locations and select one.

Person wants to compare the weather in 2 different locations. They can pin the weather of a certain place to the ui to make it easier to compare it to the weather in other places.

Person checks the weather of a certain location often. They can view their search history and select that location to avoid having to repeatedly search for the same city.

## API
