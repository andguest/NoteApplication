# Accessibility Report


## Principles of Universal Design
Our project hopes to follow as many principles of Universal design as possible. A comprehensive analysis of each principle is located below. 

### Principle 1: Equitable Use
The Software displays a Map of the city chosen and nearby cities to be more accesible to those that prefer images over text. 
The UI also has the information in a chart form, with words spaced out to be more accessible to those that have trouble processing large chunks of information. 
### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
The software aims to be as perceptible as possible by allocating a conversion button for those that may not understand metric units. 
### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
The UI is very simple as all the user has to do is type in a city in a search bar or press clearly labelled buttons, this is helpful for those that may not have much experience with our software.
### Principle 4: Perceptible Information
As mentioned before, the information uses varying modes of displaying information. Specifically, it is displayed in a chart on the right and a map is provided on the left for ease of
use.  
### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
Nothing done on the software is permanant as all changes can be reversed. Cities can be retyped if spelt wrong, units can be converted infinitly and all other features change automatically to support the user. 
### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
The concept of physical effort is not much applicible to the software is online. However, the software only requires the user to type in the city name. 
All other calculations are done in the backend or done using simple buttons. The use of buttons requires very little effort. 
### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
This concept is not much applicable to our software design. However, our program is coded in java and can be run on any platform that contains the JVM. This is especially useful for 
users with disabilities that require unique hardware. For example, since the code can run on laptops, the user can plug in an accesible keyboard and still use our software. 


## The Market
Realistically the most likely demographic for this project is those that are creating vacation plans, i.e travellers. Cultivating a list of cities nearby and using the software to 
compare the weather of those cities
may be a feature most relevant to those planning what cities to go to. For example, if you were vacationing in Mykonos and it suddenly started raining before you went to the beach, you 
may use the application to find cities around you that may not be raining. 
The Weather Alerts feature is another one that may help travel planners plan for the weather as avoidng places with severe weather hazards is preferable. 

## Demographic Usage
Since our UI only comes in smoall text on a default white background, the software is less likely to be used by those with visual impairments. Specifacally, people that are far sighted 
or those that struggle to concentrate in low contrast settings. A possible feature to add can be the use of another API to read out information and to implement a high contrast 
background. Asides from that, our software is easy to use due to the use of buttons and simple instructions and the conversion buttons. Important information such as alerts are clearly 
presented in a bold manner and unit conversion is implemented to allow users from all over the world to use our software. I dont see why any other demographics would be less likely to 
use this programs less.
